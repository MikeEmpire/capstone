			<p id="#home">LOS ANGELES, CA--Last November, I did a case study on the changes in <a
					href="https://twitter.com/ESPN" target="_blank">ESPN’s Twitter</a> during the NBA
				Bubble in connection to it’s “Black Lives Matter” coverage

			</p>
			<p>
				And it was bigger than just the Internet. The content of the stories being written, the timing of
				particular tweets, quotes of athletes, and the coverage of black women in sports were a focal point.
			</p>

			<p>After months of studying their algorithms, I noticed that ESPN was posting more “Black Lives Matter”
				content than they were prior. To make a long story short, it felt as if ESPN was forced to do
				something that they didn’t want to do.
			</p>
			<p>From being a company that once said <a
					href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/01/media/politics-in-sports-media/index.html"
					target="_blank">“stick to sports” </a>transitioning to a young black reporter such as
				Malika Andrews <a
					href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi4mcKL8sjzAhV1HzQIHVQFDZkQwqsBegQIBBAB&url=https://www.espn.com/video/clip/_/id/29957478&usg=AOvVaw118dH7bo0yBjCb31RR35JO"
					target="_blank"> crying on television</a> with the support of her fellow colleagues.</p>
			<span>It doesn’t move me one bit.
			</span>
			<p>We’ve seen this movie before. A black person dies. Athletes push more social justice. Discussions are
				had about race in America. We protest. We march. White people apologize because they feel bad that
				black people are hurting. A couple black squares on Instagram… Then, we do it…..again.</p>
			<p>
				<span>So why am I here?</span>
				It’s not to change the world, but to bring perspective to the current climate. Everyone wants to
				discuss what’s changing and where we need to go, but never wants to truly dive into where we
				actually are.

				<span>Nowhere.</span>

			<p>So, I’ve interviewed people in sports media that are working all over the landscape and are or were
				in these rooms while these things were happening and...Are happening. Right now. We are in the midst
				of history. Is there a transition in fixing black issues in the media? </p>
			<p>
				Is it another “phase?” Are white people actually taking this seriously? Or is just a part of the
				daily Slack so companies aren’t ousted in The New York Times?

			</p>
			<p>
				But before you read these interviews..Understand that these are people with jobs.
				<span>There is always a line when you are black.</span>

				So questions I ask may get truly honest answers. At the same time.. Some may just be “company”
				responses. When you are black, you are only allowed to say what you believe a certain amount of
				times until it affects the bottom line.
				So no matter how insightful these interviews may be. Take them with a grain of salt.

				<span>I’m going to give this a different approach.</span>

				Most of the people I’m interviewing, I know very well. I know when somebody believes what they are
				saying and when they are trying to keep a job. It’s never about what you think...But the fact I can
				get them to go on record is a win for us all.

				So if they won’t say what they believe...I will. Because I’m here to bring just as much perspective
				as I’m allowed. And right now, <span>I’ve got some freedom.</span>

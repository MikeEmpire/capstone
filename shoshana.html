		<p>The missing piece that I needed was perspective from a black woman in this space. As Josiah and Ryan said
			earlier,
			it&#39;s harder for black women in this space than everyone.</p>

		<p>I asked the same questions, and the answers I got where so different because she didn&#39;t come with a “woah is us”
			approach. She showed how her perspective as being a black woman in the world has more so conditioned her to expect
			what&#39;s going to happen.</p>

		<p>Not to say that she isn&#39;t optimistic, but she&#39;s been in this space for a long time.</p>

		<p>I asked her about the show she worked on “Cari & Jemele (Won&#39;t) Stick To Sports” On VICE with former ESPN talents
			Jemele Hill and Cari Champion. I asked her if she felt that the network did enough to support the show or if they
			just “half-assed” it just to say that they have black content and “care.”</p>

		<p class="quote">“ I certainly think there is a push to bring more black people into leadership. I think we&#39;ve seen
			more black
			content in the last few years than we&#39;ve seen in decades….probably ever.”</p>

		<p class="quote">“From my perspective, it can&#39;t be a bad thing...It's good. It&#39;s about time we arrived, but nothing
			is ever as simple
			as that.”</p>

		<p class="quote">“Will the people in power ever cut teeth, or will the job still continue to be a token?”</p>

		<p>She talked about when she used to work at networks and how black stories would just become “moment in time”
			pieces
			because it was the “thing” at the moment. Kind of like how Black History Month is a “thing” as if it&#39;s different
			from every other history.</p>

		<p>The point she was getting to was that if we are going to move forward, we just can&#39;t have black people in
			leadership
			positions, but you also have to let them do their job. And we discussed that the huge problem is the people who
			are
			allowed in those rooms are there because they end up “bending the knee” to these executives who are white.</p>

		<p>We talked about white women feeling the need to speak for black women. And I asked her if she sees an issue with
			the
			vetting process of trying to get ahead.</p>

		<p>“It&#39;s devastating that it took a broad day-light lynching for us to get ahead in this space.”</p>

		<p>But she was a bit confused by my question. So I asked to put it in context and the answer changed. I meant to say
			if
			she felt a way about white women using black women as a way to push their own agenda to get “women” ahead when in
			reality it&#39;s just for white women.</p>

		“You can ask for things to change, but you have to have the root to try to change.”

		<p class="quote">“I&#39;m always happy to see black content, and in the last few years there has been more and more, but
			does it mean
			that the structures of this country are changing? I don&#39;t think so. And in a way you can argue that we are going
			backwards.”</p>

		<p>To simplify things, I believe she was trying to say that she does see how people are using black people
			especially
			women as a stepping stone, but we can&#39;t fix that because black people don&#39;t really own anything to where we can
			decide who ascends or descends. It goes back to a word that we love to use in the media space today.</p>

		<p>Culture. Everyone wants the culture. But no one wants to pay the curators.</p>

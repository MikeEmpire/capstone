		<p id="#home">Ryan Cole graduated from USC in 2014. During his time here he was an intern for
			USCfootball.com, Fox Sports Radio, ESPN, and CBS News. He was also a writer for the earliest stages of
			LakersNation.com which is one of the biggest NBA fan websites in the media space. And in his freetime,
			he was even a producer for Annenberg TV News.

		</p>
		<p>
			After graduation, he would work as Production Assistant at ESPN then transition to Bleacher Report in
			2015.
			Essentially, he helped build Bleacher Report into what it is today.
		</p>

		<p>
			Why did he leave Bleacher Report? It wasn’t about the workplace necessarily, but more so about respect.
			And
			The Athletic offered Cole a mighty bag and at some points you have to do what’s best for business.
		</p>

		<p>
			In January of 2020, Howard Mittman stepped down as CEO of Bleacher Report after they were accused of
			diversity concerns in not just their hiring practices.
		</p>

		<p>
			In other words, things were a little tricky over there.
		</p>

		<p>
			“Ry” is my dog. And I was going to do my very best to trip him up and get him to answer questions I knew
			he
			didn’t want to. At the very beginning, he actually said “I know how to keep it PC enough to where I
			don’t
			incriminate myself.” But surprisingly, he was a good sport. Of course he gave the “company answers,” but
			his
			responses were what I expected from him for the most part. I asked him if he thinks the Black Lives
			Matter
			movement played a role in getting him hired pretty early.
		</p>
		<p>
			He gave me the standard answer you would expect.
		</p>

		<p class="quote">
			“When I got there, that’s when they started implementing a lot of that stuff that companies were seeing
			following the uproar of racial descent within companies..they started implementing a lot of that when I
			started.” - Ryan Cole
		</p>

		<p>
			He’s still a fresh black face. He can only speak on his own experience.
		</p>

		<p>
			I asked him how many black people work not just within the company as writers, but the higher level
			positions such as content managers, editors, and what have you...
		</p>

		<p class="quote">
			“Within the entire company, there are roughly 600-700 employees, and to my knowledge there are 50-75
			black
			people...that would be my rough estimate.”
		</p>

		<p>
			But he said most of those black people are in the writers rooms and editorial side. Which is not bad.
			The
			Athletic is making a push to get black people in more positions of power. Matter of fact, I saw recently
			that Jason Jones, a writer for the Sacramento Kings, and CJ Holmes will be covering more breaking news
			and
			feature stories around the NBA.
		</p>

		<p>
			Progress, right?
		</p>

		<p class="quote">
			“In terms of on my side of the company, the HQ side...that’s where it is very much interesting...I’m the
			only black man that works on our HQ side of the company and there are only a few black women that work
			on
			that side as well.”
		</p>

		<p>
			I asked him when he started hearing from The Athletic around March of 2020 which most of us remember
			involved of COVID-19 scares….Which meant a lot of layoffs in the media space during this time. According
			to
			the New York Times, <a
				href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/business/media/news-media-coronavirus-jobs.html">roughly 37,000
				people were laid off.</a>
		</p>

		<p>
			And during the height of this we had an uprising in the workplace because of the Black Lives Matters
			protests that were happening all across the country. Companies were feeling pressure from the black
			employees all over the landscape. And at the time, Ryan was still at Bleacher Report.
		</p>

		<p class="quote">
			“That for me became a springboard for me to explore other options.”
		</p>

		<p>
			I asked him if getting that gig had a lot to do with the color of skin.
		</p>

		<p class="quote">
			“I would be naive to think that as a young black man in a field that doesn’t have a lot of people within
			my
			level of experience to this point of my career that that’s something they found attractive for me as a
			candidate.”
		</p>

		<p>
			But he doesn’t believe that it was entirely the reason. I get it though.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the same time, he talked alot about how black people used the Black Lives Matter movement during a
			time
			to either leave their companies, or push for a raise in salary or a position within their companies. I
			have
			a definition for this. It’s called the “BLM Bag.”
			<br />

			BLM Bag - When black people receive a new job, a promotion, or more money off the strength of white
			people
			feeling pressure.
		</p>

		<p class="quote">
			“It was...to me a wild wild west I would say from that summer of 2020 a lot of black employees that work
			in tech, that work in media, that work in journalism….It was a wild west where some people that were fed
			up to the point “I’m done with this and I want to be out” and some people used it as a leveraging
			opportunity to get more money at companies they were currently at..or find companies that were searching
			for their stake in diversity and diversifying their leadership and diversifying their roles.”
		</p>

		<p>
			For a while, Ryan was pretty content with his position in the company. He felt that he was making great
			content for Bleacher Report and felt that it would all work itself out. He had stock options in
			WarnerMedia
			(and still does) and he felt that when it was time, Bleacher Report would respect what he brought to the
			table and pay him what he believed he deserved.
		</p>

		<p>He thought.</p>

		<p class="quote">“There were some things I felt I was deserving of that I felt was not being prioritized by
			the company that
			I was at before The Athletic. And The Athletic made it apparent to me that that would be able to
			somewhat
			meet that...or come close to meeting that.”</p>

		<p>Again, Ryan viewed Bleacher Report as family. He would never leave the company unless the
			bag was correct,
			but it wasn’t about that.</p>

		<p>They were willing to let him walk.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="/images/ry-bleacher.png" alt="cole at bleacher report party">

		</figure>
		<p>
			I asked him about that. To be the man behind the multi-million dollar machine and not only not be
			promised
			growth with the company, but not even respect him enough to promote him.
		</p>

		<p>
			Again, I asked him why that was and if he felt what he looked like impacted that decision.
		</p>

		<p class="quote">
			“I wouldn’t believe that it was because of me being black per say…Because I’ve observed negotiations
			like
			that from people that weren’t black that I felt I was in much higher standing in or that were also in
			higher
			standing than me and it did not go the way that they wanted. I’ve seen white people at Bleacher Report
			get
			an offer somewhere..Bring it back and Bleacher Report not counter.”
		</p>
		<p>
			From knowing Ryan personally, he is taking up for his old boss. And I understand that. But he knows deep
			down that he’s full of it. Because he and I have had personal conversations about these things that go
			on
			behind closed doors about the “vetting process” and how people who have put in less time get promoted.
			But
			he has friends at that company that he loves very much. Ruffling feathers on camera isn’t his thing and
			he
			knew I was going to bring the touch questions. He had an answer for everything.
		</p>
		<p class="quote">
			“With my offer, they countered, but they didn’t fully match….and to me that’s where I felt the ultimate
			disrespect in terms of where I felt I had earned over a five-year period...trust, credibility...and I
			think
			that for me is an example.”
		</p>

		<p>
			He went on and on about how he saw white employees in the company come back with offers from other jobs,
			but
			not counter that. They countered Ryan, but they didn’t match. They didn’t respect what he built.
		</p>

		<p>
			He blamed it on “gamesmanship” and “corporate structures.”
		</p>

		<p>
			But he didn’t put on a full cape. I can respect that.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Do I believe that there was a fundamental, racial issue as in terms of leadership positions and
			leadership
			roles? Absolutely.”
		</p>

		<p>
			I asked him….”Do you believe there still is?”
		</p>

		<p>
			He took a large “um”….And looked up to the sky.
		</p>

		<p>
			Usually, I expect an educated guess or a lie when I hear that sound.
		</p>

		<p>
			A guess that took way too long. In my world that’s mean’s yes. But he tried to be as professional as he
			could be about his beloved former employer.
		</p>

		<p class="quote">
			“Do I believe there still is? I’d say probably not...Because as I was leaving…With the public news of
			the
			CEO stepping down, the public uprising of black and brown and minorities within the company… As I was
			leaving they were already making accommodations to sort of..rectify what that looks like.”

		</p>
		<p class="quote">
			“So if that means adding a woman or person of color to a board position..If that means at the next
			review
			cycle you’re seeing more women and more people of color getting promotions and getting more positions of
			power...That was happening. And that was a result of what was happening before.”
		</p>

		<p class="quote">
			“And who’s to say that I’m not sure I have full confidence that it would have happened if that whole
			summer
			situation had not gone down...So to answer your question...Yeah, I could see that there was a chance
			that
			nothing would’ve been done if Black Lives Matter didn’t happen.”
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, I asked him what the base of this is all about.
		</p>

		<p class="quote">
			“Is it sustainable?”
		</p>
		<p>
			I asked him with a slight chuckle, but I was very serious. I brought up how we had seen this within the
			sports media space multiple times before and how the “BLM bag” was generational...And Ryan laughed. He
			knows
			that it exists and it usually only happens during a period of trauma in the black community.
		</p>

		<p>
			I was hoping that Ryan gave me an honest answer.
		</p>

		<p class="quote">
			“Yeah...um…”
		</p>

		<p>
			His voice even cracked. He was very ready to tell a lie.
		</p>

		<p>
			Luckily he didn’t. He actually told the truth about these situations from both sides of the spectrum.

		</p>
		<p class="quote">
			“I do believe that…..Opportunity I believe exists for a select few. And I think sometimes you have to
			position yourself to have a connected network and established relationships with those that can offer
			opportunities. And obviously what I think that looks like typically is white men. They typically are the
			powerholders in most of these companies and most of these industries.”
		</p>
		<p>
			In other words, you have to bend the knee to the whites to get a head in this industry.
		</p>
		<p>
			That’s just the facts in most cases. When he said “connected network” and “established relationships”
			with
			those who can help further your career, he’s talking about the people who are getting the roles in power
			that aren’t being offered to people of color.</p>
		<p>
			Basically, the route of the glaring problem.
		</p>

		<p class="quote">
			“I do think that is probably a moment...And unfortunately and sadly, I think that this is not going to
			be a
			thing that I would believe as consistent. I believe that trends would go back to what they were.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And there it is. Progress debunked.
		</p>
		<p>It was tough for Ryan to just be upfront about the ultimate reality. But you could tell that he started
			to
			reminisce on his time at his former employers and remembered how he and his peers were treated.</p>

		<p>Once he got comfortable, I asked him if he ever felt there were white employees at his job getting
			promoted
			for either less work or work that he helped build.</p>

		<p>And after all the “gamesmanship” and “corporate structure” talk…He folded.</p>

		<p class="quote">“I think I misunderstood what you were trying to say…..”</p>

		<p>Sure.</p>

		<p class="quote">“I found myself frustrated often times at Bleacher Report saying “Wait, they got promoted?”
			“Wait, they got
			promoted from entry-level to manager within a year…year and a half and I’ve been here four years and I’m
			still not even assistant manager yet and I didn’t get promoted to manager level until the end of my
			third
			year at Bleacher Report, and I only managed for a year...year and some change.”</p>

		<p class="quote">“I’ve seen a lot of people that aren’t black get that opportunity sooner with a lot less
			opportunity and a
			lot less work done.”</p>

		<p>I tried to bait him for 20 minutes into being honest, but apparently I used the wrong hook.</p>

		<p>But we got where we needed to be.</p>

		<p>I feel bad for black people in these corporate structures. The opportunity to be completely honest and
			transparent about the things going on around you doesn’t come around a lot. Food has to be put on the
			table...It’s universally understood.</p>

		<p>But everyone doesn’t roll this way. And those who’ve had enough success to where they can be truthful
			about
			what’s going on are very rare</p>

		<p>Which leads to my next guy.</p>

		<p>Ladies and gentlemen, a black man out here doing it.</p>

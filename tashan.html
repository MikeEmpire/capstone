			<p id="#home">Tashan Reed is a good friend of mine. We grew up in Ferguson, Missouri...Home to the shooting
				of Michael Brown which started a lot of these conversations we’re having. I didn’t connect with him
				until college. He graduated from the University of Missouri not too long ago. A super-talented reporter.
				It didn’t take long for him to get a job at “The Athletic” which was and still is up-and-coming. His
				first gig was the beat for the Florida State Seminoles and he absolutely killed it. So when the Raiders
				moved to Vegas, he was the guy they picked. And here we are.
			</p>
			<p>
				We wanted to interview in person, but when you are working the beat….The work never stops. Jon Gruden
				was fired as the head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders was fired for comments he made decade old emails
				where he made some <a
					href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/11/sports/football/what-did-jon-gruden-say.html"
					target="_blank">“racial” and homophobic comments.</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Sadly, the “racial” comments about Demaurice Smith and his “Michelin Tire” lips is not what got him
				fired on
				the spot.
			</p>

			<p>
				Because clearly it doesn’t matter enough.
			</p>

			<p>

				So I asked him some questions about how he felt about the workplace since the Black Lives Matter
				movement
				and if he had seen any significant changes, if he thinks that the vibe towards social justice was real,
				and
				if he thought this was a sustainable thing that would last unlike the discussions before.
			</p>

			<p class="quote">“Things are different at The Athletic since the majority of its staff worked remotely even
				prior to the pandemic, but there was an uptick in white colleagues and those of other races following
				the events of last summer. “</p>

			<p class="quote">“There were more organic conversations about social justice in addition to formal ones
				organized by the company. There have been employee-run groups at The Athletic since 2019 called “The
				Athletic Communities” and I worked as part of the leadership team for the one we started for Black
				people. We had already made efforts to discuss race within the company and push agendas such as
				diversifying our staff, but it became more of a company-wide effort last year.”
			</p>

			<p class="quote">
				“I've accepted it as my responsibility as a Black person to talk about race and social justice on a
				regular basis since my career started. So, while it was more relevant to my day-to-day job as more
				athletes and leagues got involved in those spaces last year, my thinking didn't really change.”

			<p>
				Tashan’s not lying here. As long as I've followed him covering sports, he’s always been pretty adamant
				about
				his opinions on race in America and how he feels about white people. So he didn’t just start
				pandering...Matter of fact...he dove even deeper into the discussions.
			</p>

			<p>Before Gruden was fired, he wrote a story with the headline <a
					href="https://theathletic.com/2877784/2021/10/08/reed-raiders-coach-jon-gruden-must-prove-his-racist-comment-isnt-indicative-of-his-character/"
					target="_blank">Jon Gruden must prove his racist comment
					isn’t indicative of his character</a> and he caught some negative backlash because even
				still...People
				don’t want to see the potential issue in Gruden’s comments about the executive director of the NFLPA.
				And there wasn’t much bias in his column. Just very honest reporting. And I can appreciate that.
			</p>
			<p class="quote">“I wouldn't say I've received any tangible benefits personally as a result of last year,
				but it does seem
				like more employees at The Athletic are aware of and empathetic to issues of race and social justice. We
				hired someone to preside over diversity and inclusion. We brought on multiple Black people in leadership
				positions. And it seems that diversity is more of a focus in the general hiring process. It's still a
				work
				in progress and will likely remain that way for the foreseeable future, but gains have been made.”</p>

			<p>Tashan is telling his truth.</p>

			<p>The Athletic is the only company he has ever worked for full-time. In 2017, The Athletic’s CEO said that
				the
				site was <a
					href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nydailynews.com/sports/new-site-athletic-reflects-old-sports-media-diversity-problem-article-1.3458067?outputType=amp">having
					issues creating a diverse team.</a> Tashan joined in July of 2018.</p>
			<p>I texted Tashan this quote from the CEO after we spoke and he responded:</p>
			<p class="quote">“We have more black people now than last year. I didn’t say the staff was diverse.”</p>
			<p>
				You see the change in tone? That’s why I said earlier...Listen to the interviews, but take everything
				with a grain of salt.
			</p>
			<p>
				But to make sure this wasn’t all “cap,” as kids call it, I reached out to another friend of mine. A guy
				who was just appointed the manager of Content Programming at The Athletic in August of 2020.

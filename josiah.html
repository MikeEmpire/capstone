				Josiah is the son of NBA Hall of Famer Marques Johnson, but he also played basketball for the UCLA
				Bruins
				from
				2000-05. He’s worked all over the space for the last 15 years. He’s been a producer at FOX Sports, NFL
				Network,
				Showtime, Comedy Central, Complex, and even has a show he helped write and produce for Netflix’s “Colin
				in
				Black
				& White.”
			</p>
			<p>
				He’s also built a lane for himself in the sports media space and is known as the “King of NBA Twitter.”
				He
				even
				has a feature in the New York Times about how he has helped build the social sports platform on Twitter
				and
				how
				others are trying to replicate it.
			</p>


			<p>Everybody shows him love for his work….Even the people who work at Twitter. But nobody wants to give him
				a
				job
				in the lane he helped create.</p>

			<p>It’s funny how that works.</p>

			<p>People are being paid to copy the work of others.</p>
			<p>Specifically Josiah Johnson.</p>

			<p>Luckily for Josiah, he has gotten to the point in his career where he is unfiltered about how he feels
				about
				what’s going on in the media and creators in the black community.</p>

			<p>Honestly, this is going to be the only interview I’ve had where I know I’m getting the whole truth and
				nothing,
				but the truth.</p>

			<p>The quotes cut like butter with a hot knife.</p>

			<p class="quote">“When you look at what’s going on in the world, especially in the world of social
				media..there’s a lot of
				performative stuff.” - Josiah Johnson</p>

			<p>Damn. In my eyes, he hit it right on the nose.</p>

			<p>When he talks about being performative, it covers a multitude of things. You can compare to the Twitter
				posts
				on
				ESPN that I talked about earlier.</p>

			<p>For example, those black squares you all posted on Instagram this summer as a “movement.”</p>

			<p>Yes, black people want more representation and heavier discussions about what’s going on in our world,
				but
				forcing it to either not get in trouble or to push for a job is…….not bad at all honestly.</p>

			<p>White people have been doing this for years.</p>

			<p>If pandering to black trauma is what people believe will force a breakthrough in these media spaces, so
				be
				it...
				It can get annoying sometimes, but I can’t blame them.</p>

			<p>If white guilt pays...can you blame those for capitalizing?</p>

			<p>But Josiah doesn’t move by this drum. He’s overcome. And he basically works for himself.</p>

			<p>He answers to nobody.</p>

			<p class="quote">“I try to be for people who look up to me that you don’t need all that stuff....I’m
				basically a
				one-man band...I
				go rogue...I can do a lot of those same things that a lot of big companies can do that don’t necessarily
				give
				black people opportunity.”</p>

			<p class="quote">“A lot of performative acts, there’s town hall meetings that are going to address black
				issues
				the next day like
				three or four white people got promoted.”</p>

			<p>And we both laughed. Because it’s true.</p>

			<p class="quote">“It’s just to keep workers.”</p>

			<p>We talked about the other people I interviewed. He linked up with my boy Tashan in Vegas and he also
				happens
				to
				know Ryan pretty well. I told him about how they went about what they said is going on in their worlds
				in
				terms
				of black empowerment and diversifying the workplace.</p>

			<p>And he gave some thoughts that only Josiah can give.</p>

			<p class="quote">“Ton of respect for Tashan...Ton of respect for Ry...But it sucks because they are in
				situations where obviously
				they have a job where they can’t be as vocal as they would like to be. And that’s why I kind of take on
				those
				reigns because I don’t really give a fuck about anything, honestly. I’ll be fine no matter what happens
				and
				I
				think I try to be the voice for a lot of these different people because the situations are a little
				ridiculous
				and absurd.”</p>

			<p>This goes back to what I said earlier. Black people don’t get to speak out about stuff. We actually lose
				our
				jobs. But again, Josiah has a special lane where his only boss is himself.</p>

			<p class="quote">“You’re talking about leagues that are 60-70% black. So we have enough talent to dominate
				these
				leagues, but not
				enough talent to talk about these leagues. A couple years, where people were posting their social teams
				and
				people were like “Damn, you got no black people.”</p>

			<p>A tale as old as time….but now are facing a different beast in an attempt to keep black people out of the
				game.
				And he talked about it because many are scared to.</p>

			<p class="quote">“You guys try to talk black, really take elements of black culture and more or less you
				know...rape our culture
				and use that to get themselves along.”</p>

			<p>Then, he brought up the multiple times he’s seen these things happen in the industry...And guess who he
				brought
				up?</p>

			<p>Your’s truly. And it hit home.</p>

			<p>Story time?</p>

			<p>Last March, I had a person on Bleacher Report (who you guessed it….was white) and he messaged me on
				Twitter
				saying “You are definitely the person to answer this question: Does Drake have a lyric that mentions
				USC?”
			</p>

			<p>This is important because this is a person who receives payment to pretend to be a part of black culture
				and
				gets paid a large sum of money for it. Sadly, there wasn’t a lyric for Drake and USC, but that isn’t the
				point.
				If you can’t do this, why are you employed? And if you felt that I was the person to ask...Why do I not
				have
				a
				job at your company? Especially your job.</p>

			<p>And it happened to others too.</p>

			<p>John Rivers, a friend of mine, got his idea stolen by this same guy copying his tone and format. John
				Rivers
				is
				another black friend of mine who works in the industry. He is really good at Twitter, but also works in
				television behind the camera. But his presence online is an absolute force.</p>

			<p>I called the guy out on it and he said that let the guy know he was stealing his stuff and that it was a
				way
				of
				giving “flowers,” which is cool, but…...John Rivers didn’t get paid. So what the hell are we doing?
				Another
				black man getting his creativity raped without out consequence.</p>

			<p>This is the stuff Josiah is talking about.</p>

			<p>He also discussed another “secret” amongst black people working in the media.</p>

			<p>Mom always had a saying….”Everything is great until you are doing better than them.”</p>

			<p>Black people in our industry also operate this way at times because there can usually only be so many at
				the
				top. The idea is that keeping “your own” beneath will help secure your spot.</p>

			<p>And that goes for most people.</p>

			<p>Not just blacks.</p>

			<p>But Josiah brought it up and it was a great discussion because that’s the talk that everyone wants to run
				from.
				Pretending that all black people are for progressing us forward just isn’t true. There are only so many
				spots.</p>

			<p class="quote">“You find sometimes in those spaces, especially at the corporate level...I’ve dealt with
				this
				on the
				entertainment side and social, black people get to a certain level and they don’t want to help other
				people
				because they think it’s going to fuck up their shit.”</p>

			<p>Josiah was so honest and transparent in his interview, I couldn’t really think of anything anymore. He
				said
				it
				all.</p>

			<p>But I pulled something out of my sleeve. Something very straight up.</p>

			<p class="quote">I asked him “How much money do you think we as black people made in the media space this
				year
				off of straight
				pandering.”</p>

			<p>When I say pandering, it means in the terms of tweeting about “Black Lives Matter” for attention and
				engagement,
				calling out white people like you never have before because it’s in, caring about stuff in the community
				you
				may
				not have gave attention to before because white people weren’t feeling bad….and other things.</p>

			<p> And again….another truthful answer. He even laughed because everybody knows what they are trying to do
				when
				they
				do this.</p>

			<p class="quote">“I’ll pander if I need to...that’s a part of the game, but you have to play a certain
				role.”
			</p>

			<p>Then, he went into a story about how he interviewed for a writing job recently and how he saw this other
				black
				writer walk out and take a gasp of fresh air because he could finally be himself again.</p>

			<p>It’s stuff that black people have to do just to get employed. Pander to whites where you see fit.</p>

			<p>You kinda have to play this role...play this game...show that you’re one of the good ones to be able to
				get a
				bag and a job.”</p>

			<p>He even brought it back to the events of this summer.</p>

			<p class="quote">“They not putting that black square because they give a fuck about whatever’s going on.
				They
				put up that
				black
				square because they get a bunch of likes and it makes them feel good.”</p>
